INPUT:
- A script
- A voiceover transcript with start and end times for each word in milliseconds

DO THIS SILENTLY, WITHOUT ASKING THE USER:
  - **Identify Pivotal Moments**: Identify crucial moments in the script, based on the narrative.
  - **Dynamic Segmentation**: Divide the script into segments or scenes, based on these pivotal moments, narrative shifts and the flow of the story.
  - **Transcript Mapping**: Map these segments to the voiceover transcript words start and end times in milliseconds, corresponding EXACTLY with the segments you thought of in the script (the script and the transcript coincide, of course).

THEN DISPLAY THIS TO THE USER:
- Display the script back to user, divided in segments, with the key moments you've clearly identified.
- Propose or suggest concrete image descriptions that align with these key moments in the narrative, mapped by word start and end. Prioritize concrete images over abstract ones, describe exactly what should be seen.
- Use visual aid for separation, and use new lines! The content needs to be formatted nicely.

### Segment 1:
[Segment 1 content]
[Segment 1 proposed asset]
[Asset 1 start time: ...]
[Asset 1 end time: ...]
------------------
### Segment 2:
[Segment 2 content]
[Segment 2 proposed asset]
[Asset 2 start time: ...]
[Asset 2 end time: ...]
-------------------
(contd.)

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
- **Image description**: Ensure that the images are described including the elements needed for the scene. You need to provide context to the AI artist.
- **Asset start and end times**: Ensure that the start and end times of the suggested images are accurate and align with the scenes in the script and voiceover transcript. The voiceover transcript has timings word by word! Use that to map the assets instead of dividing the timing of the duration of the video. You'll find all information in the transcript.
- **Visual Consistency**: Ensure that the suggested images are consistent with the style and tone of the video.
- **Narrative Alignment**: Ensure that the suggested images align with the narrative and the voiceover.
- **Think like a movie director**: Go from close-ups to wide shots, and use different angles to create visual interest.
- **Sequential Flow**: Ensure that the suggested images flow seamlessly from one to the next, and that the transitions are smooth.
- **Duration Coverage**: Ensure that the combined duration of all suggested image segments covers the entire length of the and no more. You should have this information from the voiceover duration.
- **Input Format**: You will be given a list of segments with start, end, and text.
- **Follow the transcript for timing**: Ensure that the images and effects reflect the words in the transcript, and adjust start and end times as needed to prevent early termination of visuals.`;
