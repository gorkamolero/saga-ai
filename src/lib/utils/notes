/*
pattern
string
Pattern for the animation. Must be comma-separated list of floats enclosed in curly braces.

animationLength
number [ 1 .. 6 ]
Duration of the animation. This controls how fast or slow the animation should be. For example, a value of 1 would create the fastest and 6 would create the slowest animations.

amplitudeX
number [ 0 .. 10 ]
Amount of motion in X axis.

amplitudeY
number [ 0 .. 10 ]
Amount of motion in Y axis.

amplitudeZ
number [ 0 .. 10 ]
Amount of motion in Z axis.

phaseX
number [ 0 .. 7 ]
The starting point or offset of the motion in the x-axis. For example, a phase value of 0 indicates that the motion starts from the origin.

phaseY
number [ 0 .. 7 ]
The starting point or offset of the motion in the Y-axis. For example, a phase value of 0 indicates that the motion starts from the origin.

phaseZ
number [ 0 .. 7 ]
The starting point or offset of the motion in the Z-axis. For example, a phase value of 0 indicates that the motion starts from the origin.

gain
number [ 0 .. 10 ]
Floating point gain value

convergence
number [ -1 .. 1 ]
A floating point number that specifies the convergence between -1 to 1.


Effects to achieve:
Horizontal
phaseX = 1, phaseY = 0, phaseZ = 0, amplitudeX = 0.0, amplitudeY = 0.25, amplitudeZ = 0.25

Circle
phaseX = 1, phaseY = 1, phaseZ = 0, amplitudeX = 0.0, amplitudeY = 0.25, amplitudeZ = 0.25   
        
Vertical
phaseX = 0, phaseY = 1, phaseZ = 0, amplitudeX = 0.0, amplitudeY = 0.25, amplitudeZ = 0.25    

Perspective
phaseX = 1, phaseY = 0.25, phaseZ = 1, amplitudeX = 0.0, amplitudeY = 0.25, amplitudeZ = 0.25
